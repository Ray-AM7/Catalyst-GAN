CataGAN

WIP

Overview

This repository hosts the implementation of an Artificial Intelligence system for catalyst discovery utilizing a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The AI aims to speed up the process of identifying potential catalysts by generating 3D molecular structures.

The code for training the model is in Training.ipynb, and is a WIP
